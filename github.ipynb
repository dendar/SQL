    "## Jupyter Notebook Content\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Jupyter notebook, you capture the requirements Jeff Leek describes in these sections:\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Business understanding\n",
    "- Data understanding\n",
    "- Data preparation\n",
    "- Modeling\n",
    "- Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Title\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the name of your files and repository, the title of the notebook should also be descriptive. “Project Notebook” is not as informative as “EDA, Modeling, and Evaluation”. An even more descriptive title might be “House Price Prediction: Data Exploration, Modeling and Results”. There should be no question in a viewer’s mind as to what is contained in your notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the title, you should also give an overview of your notebook’s contents right at the top of the notebook. This allows a reader to easily skim for the content they’re looking for, as well as to know exactly what is contained within the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Business Understanding\n",
    "This section clearly explains the real-world value the project has for a specific stakeholder, and how a problem will be addressed by this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example questions to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much time will this solution save?\n",
    "- Who will this solution help?\n",
    "- What need does this analysis address?\n",
    "- How well does the metric or target variable directly relate to the real world problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "This section relates your data source and the properties of variables to the real-world problem of interest. Jumping straight into the modeling without demonstrating a thorough understanding of the data is amateur hour. A robust data understanding section will describe the source and properties of all the variables used in the data preparation and modeling sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example questions to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can someone else replicate your entire data preparation process?\n",
    "- If you created the data through scraping or an API, can someone repeat that process?\n",
    "- In what form is the data stored?\n",
    "- Can someone else easily run the code to take the raw data and get it ready for analysis?\n",
    "- Is the code in pipeline form?\n",
    "- Is all the preprocessing code in the notebook, or is it in separate py files?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "While model development is an iterative process, not every analysis explored should be in your final project notebook. Models should be correct, iterative, and fully documented, including valid justification for decisions. Models are developed iteratively and justifiably, proceeding from a simple baseline model to more complex models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example questions to be answered:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is the information you are including absolutely relevant?\n",
    "- Is your final model specified in an equation or pseudocode, and not just specified in code?\n",
    "- When you describe the parameter or coefficients, do you describe them in real terms?\n",
    "- Have you examined any problems with the data that might be impacting the quality of your analysis or model?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation is not just about accuracy or r-squared score. While those metrics are important, the evaluation section also needs to address how well (or not) the model solves the original business problem. The limitations are just as important as the successes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example questions about the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What evaluation metrics did you use?\n",
    "- Were there special considerations you made when choosing that evaluation metric?\n",
    "- How does your model’s metric compare to industry standards or what is already out there?\n",
    "- Was cross validation included in your process and what concerns did that address?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example questions about the application:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the limitations of interpreting your analysis?\n",
    "- What next steps would you take in this analysis? What new data would you want to incorporate?\n",
    "- How well does your analysis answer the actual business question?\n",
    "- What sort of impact would your results actually have?\n",
    "\n",
    "## README Content\n",
    "The README is at once an abstract, a road map, and a how-to manual. While perhaps not labeled explicitly, a quality README includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Content summary\n",
    "\n",
    "- Detailed description of your business question\n",
    "- A summary of your data science process, findings, and ideas for future improvement\n",
    "- At least one interesting visualization from your analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Road map\n",
    "\n",
    "- Repository navigation\n",
    "- Links to the presentation slides, notebook, and other relevant documentation\n",
    "- Links to sources, such as the data, papers referenced, or other important materials\n",
    "\n",
    "### How-to manual\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reproduction instructions\n",
    "- Contact information"
